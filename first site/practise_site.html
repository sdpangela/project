<h2>WHY a blog?</h2>
<p> One day it crossed my mind that I wanted to share my life experiences, my thoughts and opinions and maybe help out other young people out there. I am not the most perfect person, and I make so many mistakes that I still do regret. I struggly with myself, and I am still learning to love myself and acceot myself as who I am.
  I became aware that I am not the only person with theses problems, so I thought this could help someone as well if we go through this journey together.
